            <p>For this project, I chose to represent the number of eggs I consume in a week vs. the number of vegetables displayed as pieces on a Connect 4 game board. 
                Each column of the game represents one day of the week with the yellow pieces representing eggs and the red pieces representing the specific vegetables I ate.
                I chose this game board to represent my data not only because it is a game I enjoy but also because I believe it can show clearly how one team (the eggs) fills
                the board consistently outnumbering the other (the vegetables). The game board itself shows all the pieces in the respective days and I also included the remaining
                pieces of each color. While there are 6 red pieces (vegetables) left, there are only 3 yellow pieces (eggs). The goal of this representation was to visualization the disparity of vegetables in my weekly 
                diet and how I rely on eggs for easy meals. </p>
            <brk></brk>
            <p>Although this isn’t data that necessarily correlates to each other, since starting grad school I’ve noticed how I veer towards simple meals and don’t eat many
                vegetables. I also tend to overspend on eggs at grocery stores rather than Costco because I underestimate the volume I go through while I consistently have
                vegetables I buy go bad before I can eat them. I sought to fully understand the numbers of each food I was going through to further understand my diet and 
                also optimize the way I grocery shop. </p>

            <p>When I first started ideating how I wanted to present my data, I was stuck in ideas of showing numeric data and tying in the egg theme. When I read chapter 3 of Data Feminism, 
                I was drawn to the line that any “communicating object that reflects choices about the selection and representation of reality is a rhetorical object” (D’Ignazio, Klein).
                 I decided to go for a more creative approach and be less worried about creating a traditionally convincing artifact as I would still be communicating through my work. I went through a few iterations, but realized the 
                 Connect 4 game I owned had 7 columns that could represent 7 days of the week. Additionally, there are two different colors of pieces similar to how I had two different
                categories of food. </p>
            <brk></brk>
            <p>When I decided to move forward with this idea, I began by first sketching out each of the needed pieces. I used sketch paper I already had and create a 1x1
               inch to scale each drawing. I referred to my data from one week to total up the counts needed for the eggs and each vegetable and drew a few extras in case I had 
               trouble while cutting them. After sketching, I used colored pencils to color each piece then cut them out individually. I finished by taping the drawings to their corresponding colored piece
               and filling the board day by day according to my recorded data.

            <p>Originally, I had planned to 3D print the eggs and the various vegetables. I wanted to paint then attach magnets
                to each piece to then stick them onto a calendar design on my fridge. I enlisted the help of my partner who knows
                how to 3D model and owns a 3D printer. However, we attempted to print a couple different versions, but there was an
                issue with the filament when printing such small shapes. The filament we were using was older and did not seem able to
                handle the design. The first image here is of a free model of an egg that I found online 
                that my partner prepared for the print. The second is where we stopped the print due to the failed printing. I had already
                peeled off the prints from the plate but placed a few back on to take a picture. </p>
                <brk> </brk>
            <p> Because continuous failed builds with this old filament could damage the printer, I decided
                to pivot away from this idea. Because I was already attached to the idea of a physical visualization, this is when I decided to instead
                draw, color, and cut out each piece instead.</p>

            <h2>Data Collection Process</h2>
            <p>I decided to manually collect the data for this project. I created a Notion table to track both the eggs I ate each day and the vegetables.
                I tried to remember to enter in data daily, but if I forgot, I never had any issues remembering how many of each food I had ate previously. Originally,
                I had planned to collect and use 10 days of data, but I decided to use 7 days of data instead. As there are 21 pieces of each color in Connect 4, 
                the data from seven days fit very closely to this number whereas I would have run out of yellow pieces for the eggs if I had used all 10 days of data instead.
